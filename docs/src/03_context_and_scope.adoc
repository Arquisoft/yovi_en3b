Technical Details
YEN Notation: All game-related data exchange (size, turn, players, and layout) must strictly follow the JSON-based YEN notation.

Coordinate Systems: The system handles the coordinates using both barycentric coordinates (x, y, z) and linear indices.

Deployment: The application is designed to be deployed (through Docker) and publicly accessible via the Web.
