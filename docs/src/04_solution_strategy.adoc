=== Strategic Decisions

[cols="1,1,2" options="header"]
|===
| Goal / Problem | Decision | Rationale

| **Database Technology**
| **SQL (PostgreSQL)**
| The team selected a relational database to ensure data integrity and robustness. PostgreSQL was chosen specifically for being open-source and fulfilling our requirements. It also offers hybrid support (relational/non-relational) for future flexibility.

| **Backend Architecture**
| **Component-based & Layered**
| To ensure maintainability and scalability, the backend is organized into independent components. Internally, each component is divided into three strict layers: **entry-points, domain, and data-access**.

| **Game Logic Engine**
| **Rust**
| The core logic for the "Game Y" is isolated in a separate module developed in Rust to ensure performance and safety.

| **Frontend Strategy**
| **Web Application (React)**
| The user interface is developed as a web application. The team prioritized Quality of Life (QoL) features such as **Hints** and **Undo button**, while discarding complex media features like video chat.

| **Security**
| **Hashing & Environment Variables**
| User passwords will be encrypted using a hashing algorithm. Database credentials are managed via environment variables to prevent hardcoding sensitive data in the source code.

| **Ranking System**
| **Winrate Metric**
| The ranking functionality focuses specifically on the win/loss ratio (won matches against played) to simplify the data model and presentation layer.

=== Organizational & Development Strategy

Decisions regarding team coordination and workflow to ensure project quality:

* **Task Distribution:** Work is divided into fixed sub-groups of 2-3 people (Frontend, Backend, Rust/Docs) to ensure code reviews and knowledge sharing.
* **GitHub Workflow:**
** Pull Requests are reviewed by the sub-group (Frontend/Backend) NOT related to the topic itself, ensuring shared understanding of project upgrades among team members.
* **Documentation:** Developed collaboratively and consolidated in specific sessions.
