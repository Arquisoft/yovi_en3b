=== Strategic Decisions

[cols="1,1,2" options="header"]
|===
| Goal / Problem | Decision | Rationale

| **Database Technology**
| **SQL (PostgreSQL)**
| A relational database ensures data integrity for users and matches. PostgreSQL offers flexibility and robustness for long-term storage.

| **Backend Architecture**
| **Component-based & Layered**
| Organized into independent components with layers (entry-points, domain, data-access) to ensure maintainability and separation of concerns.

| **Game Logic Engine**
| **Rust**
| High-performance engine to handle Game Y logic. It allows the implementation of complex AI strategies without sacrificing response time.

| **Frontend Technology**
| **Web Application (React)**
| The user interface is developed as a web application. The team prioritized Quality of Life (QoL) features such as Hints and Undo button, while discarding complex media features like video chat.

| **AI Levels**
| **Selectable Difficulty**
| The system provides multiple difficulty levels. This satisfies the requirement of having more than one machine strategy (e.g., Random vs. Minimax).

| **User Interaction**
| **Text-based Chat**
| A lightweight text chat is implemented to enhance social interaction between players without the technical overhead of video/audio streaming.

| **Security**
| **Hashing & Env Variables**
| Encryption for passwords and environment variables for secrets to follow security best practices.

| **Ranking System**
| **Winrate Metric**
| Focuses on the win/loss ratio to provide a simple but competitive ranking for the leaderboard.

=== Organizational & Development Strategy

* **Task Distribution:** Divided into Frontend, Backend, and Rust/Docs sub-groups.
* **Review Process:** Cross-group Pull Request reviews to ensure the whole team understands the full stack.
* **Continuous Integration:** Automated testing and deployment to catch integration errors between the TS and Rust modules early.
