**YOVI** is a gaming suite developed for **Micrati** based on "Game Y". The system allows users to play hexagonal board games against the computer and provides an interface for external bots.

Key functional requirements include:

* **Core Gameplay:** Implementation of classic Game Y with variable board sizes.
* **AI Strategies:** Support for multiple machine strategies and selectable difficulty levels.
* **User Management:** Registration and match history tracking (win/loss stats).
* **External Access:** A fully documented API for bot interaction using **YEN notation**.
* **Public Availability:** The system must be deployed and accessible via the web.
