== Introduction and Goals

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. 
These include

* underlying business goals, 
* essential features, 
* essential functional requirements, 
* quality goals for the architecture and
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations
****
endif::arc42help[]

=== Requirements Overview

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Quality Goals

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities
****
endif::arc42help[]

The following table presents the top five quality goals for the YOVI architecture, ordered by priority. These goals have been identified based on stakeholder expectations and the ISO 25010 quality model. They represent the most critical quality attributes that will guide architectural decisions throughout the project and serve as the primary criteria for evaluating the success of the system.

|===
|Priority|Quality Goal|Concrete Scenario

|1
|**Performance Efficiency**
|The Rust engine must respond to move validation and AI suggestions in under 200ms, ensuring a smooth gameplay experience even during peak usage.

|2
|**Compatibility (Interoperability)**
|The system must allow external bots to connect via a well-documented JSON API (YEN notation), enabling third-party developers to create their own game clients.

|3
|**Functional Suitability**
|The Rust engine must accurately implement all "Game Y" rules, and the web frontend must cover all user stories including registration, gameplay, and statistics.

|4
|**Maintainability**
|The architecture must keep Rust logic independent from the TypeScript layer, with clear ADRs and >80% code coverage, allowing evaluators and future developers to understand and modify the system.

|5
|**Transferability**
|The complete system must be deployable with a single Docker command, ensuring evaluators can easily install and test the application on any modern environment.

=== Stakeholders

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.

This section provides an explicit overview of the stakeholders of the system. Stakeholders include all persons, roles, or organizations that should know the architecture, need to be convinced of it, have to work with the architecture or codebase, require the documentation for their work, or are involved in making decisions about the system and its development. We have identified the following stakeholders related to our project:
