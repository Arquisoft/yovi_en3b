.Contents
A list of identified technical risks or technical debts, ordered by priority.

.Motivation
“Risk management is project management for grown-ups” (Tim Lister, Atlantic Systems Guild.) 

.Form
According to the arc42 standard, we have identified the following risks. These are categorized into Project/Human Resources, Technical, and Requirements risks.

[cols="1,2,2,2", options="header"]
|===
| Risk Category | Risk Description | Proactive Measure (Prevention) | Contingent Measure (Reaction)

| *Project / HR* | *Team Attrition:* Members dropping the course or abandoning the project. 
| Maintain updated documentation and clean code so any member can take over a task. 
| Redistribute the workload using GitHub Issues and reduce the scope to an MVP.

| *Project / HR* | *Uneven Learning Curves:* Members struggling with Rust or other technologies. 
| Conduct internal knowledge-sharing sessions and use "Pair Programming" for difficult modules. 
| Reassign tasks based on individual strengths and simplify the complexity of the affected module.

| *Project / HR* | *Final Exam Pressure:* Development stall during the final weeks of the semester. 
| Establish an internal deadline for the "Base Project" 2 weeks before the official deadline. 
| Shift to "Maintenance Mode," focusing only on fixing critical bugs and documentation.

| *Project / HR* | *Git/Merge Conflicts:* Major regressions due to lack of coordination. 
| Use a "Feature Branch" workflow and require at least one peer review for every Pull Request. 
| Perform emergency "Pair Programming" sessions to manually resolve conflicts and restore stability.

| *Technical* | *Rust Learning Curve:* Failure to implement complex AI due to ownership/borrowing difficulty. 
| Start with small POCs (Proof of Concept) to master YEN parsing and basic Rust logic early. 
| Implement a basic "Random Move" strategy first and use simpler Rust crates to meet requirements.

| *Technical* | *Integration Failures:* Misinterpretation of the *YEN notation* format. 
| Define a shared JSON Schema for YEN messages that both TS and Rust must validate against. 
| Conduct an integration meeting to align the interfaces and fix the parser/generator logic.

| *Technical* | *Deployment Bottlenecks:* CI/CD or cloud provider issues preventing public access. 
| Perform a "Hello World" deployment in the first month to test the pipeline. 
| Manually deploy to an alternative provider.

| *Technical* | *Algorithm Complexity:* Poorly optimized Rust algorithms causing timeouts/crashes. 
| Set performance benchmarks for the logic engine and conduct load tests on the validator. 
| Limit the maximum board size in the UI to prevent the server from hanging.

| *Requirements* | *Incomplete Feature Set:* Prioritizing UI over mandatory AI strategies. 
| Use a GitHub board to ensure "more than one strategy" is prioritized in the backlog. 
| Pivot resources from UI polish to back-end logic to ensure all grading criteria are met.

| *Requirements* | *API Security:* Bot API vulnerability to spam or unauthorized access. 
| Implement basic rate-limiting and API key validation for the external bot interface. 
| Temporarily disable the public API or increase server resources if stability is compromised.

| *Requirements* | *Scalability Debt:* Hard-coding rules, making variants (Tabu Y, etc.) impossible. 
| Use the "Strategy Pattern" in Rust to keep game rules separate from the core engine. 
| Refactor only the core logic needed for the mandatory variants if time allows.
|===

.Technical Debt
* [ ] *AI Strategies:* Currently planning basic algorithms; advanced heuristics remain as debt.
* [ ] *Test Coverage:* Goal is >80% coverage; current debt includes edge-case testing for YEN.
* [ ] *Code Refactoring:* Some "quick fixes" in the Rust engine need to be modularized for better scalability.
