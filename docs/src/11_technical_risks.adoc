== Risks and Technical Debt

=== Risk Mitigation Table

[cols="1,2,2" options="header"]
|===
|Risk |Proactive Measure |Contingent Measure

|**Team Attrition**
|Maintain clean code and updated documentation so any member can take over.
|Redistribute tasks among remaining members; focus on MVP features.

|**Uneven Learning Curves**
|Conduct internal "Pair Programming" sessions for difficult modules (Rust).
|Reassign tasks based on individual strengths and simplify complexity.

|**Rust Learning Curve**
|Develop small Proof-of-Concepts (POCs) for YEN parsing and AI logic early.
|Use simpler AI strategies (e.g., Random Move) if logic becomes a bottleneck.

|**Integration Failures**
|Define a shared JSON Schema for YEN validation between TS and Rust.
|Hold emergency integration meetings to align data formats and parsers.

|**Final Exam Pressure**
|Set internal deadlines 2 weeks before the official delivery date.
|Shift focus to critical bug fixes and mandatory documentation only.

|**Deployment Failures**
|Configure and test CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions) in the first month.
|Perform manual deployments to alternative providers (e.g., Fly.io or Render).

=== Technical Debt

* **AI Complexity:** Initial AI versions will use basic heuristics; advanced algorithms are considered debt for later sprints.
* **Test Coverage:** Reaching 80% automated coverage is a pending goal while focusing on core features.
* **YEN Robustness:** Deep validation for malformed JSON from external bots is yet to be fully implemented.
