=== Whitebox Overall System

image::level-1-overview.png["YOVI Level 1 Overview Diagram"]

Motivation::
The YOVI system is designed according to the principle of Separation of Concerns. A modern Web layer (TypeScript) was chosen for the user interface and bot access, a scalable microservice (Node.js) for data management, and a low-level system language (Rust) for high-performance game logic/AI calculations. This hybrid structure optimizes development speed and runtime performance.

Contained Building Blocks::
[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| **Webapp** | React-based user interface. Visualizes the game board, handles user registration, and provides an external API (REST) for bots.
| **Users Service** | Backend service that manages user profiles, authentication processes, and game statistics.
| **Gamey Engine** | Game engine written in Rust. Performs move validation, checks if the game is won, and generates bot move suggestions (AI).
| **PostgreSQL** | Relational database where user data and match results are permanently stored.
|===

Important Interfaces::
* **YEN Notation:** Standard JSON format carrying board state and move information between the Webapp and Gamey Engine.
* **REST API (Internal):** Endpoints enabling the Webapp to communicate with the Users Service.

==== Webapp (Black Box)
Purpose/Responsibility:: 
Providing the user interface and providing system access for external bots.

Interface(s):: 
Web GUI (HTML/CSS/TS), External Bot REST API.

Directory/File Location:: 
`/webapp`

Fulfilled Requirements:: 
Web frontend (Classic Game Y), Bot interaction API, User registration.

==== Users Service (Black Box)
Purpose/Responsibility:: 
Managing user information and game history (metrics) by communicating with the database.

Interface(s):: 
Internal REST API (Node.js/Express).

Directory/File Location:: 
`/users`

Fulfilled Requirements:: 
Registration system, View match history, win/loss statistics.

==== Gamey Engine (Black Box)
Purpose/Responsibility:: 
Flawless execution of game rules (Game Y) and provision of AI strategies at different difficulty levels.

Interface(s):: 
YEN Service Interface (JSON/HTTP).

Quality/Performance Characteristics:: 
High calculation speed (Rust), Memory safety and high concurrency support.

Directory/File Location:: 
`/gamey`

Fulfilled Requirements:: 
Verify match status, Suggest next move, Multiple strategies (AI).

==== White Box Gamey Engine
Since the Gamey Engine is the system's most complex logic unit, its internal structure is detailed below.
